## PSPDFKit - The definite solution for displaying and annotating PDF on iOS.

PSPDFKit is a heavily optimized framework for displaying PDF files with horizontal scrolling.
It is fast, flexible, has intelligent caching and renders pages usually faster than iBooks.

*Amazingly easy to use and impressive PDF performance - closest thing to iBooks so far.* -- [Martin Reichart, iOS Developer](http://twitter.com/martinr_vienna/status/95823509506359296)
