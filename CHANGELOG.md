# Changelog

__v1.6.14 - 22/Oct/2011__

*  fixes bug where delete method of PSPDFCache (removeCacheForDocument) was deleting the whole directory of the pdf instead of just the related files

__v1.6.13 - 22/Oct/2011__

*  removed the zeroing weak reference helper. If you use custom delegates for PSPDFCache, you now need to manually deregister them. Upside: better management of delegates. 

__v1.6.12 - 19/Oct/2011__

*  changed: turns out, when compiling with Xcode 4.2/Clang, you'll loose binary compatibility with objects linked from 4.1. Thus, the framework crashed with EXC_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION when compiled within an older Xcode. I will use 4.1 some more time to give everyone the change to upgrade, but due to some *great* improvements in Clang 3.0 compiler that ships with Xcode 4.2 (e.g. nilling out of structs accessed from a nil object) it's highly advised that you use Xcode 4.2. If you use the source code directly, this is not an issue at all.

__v1.6.11 - 14/Oct/2011__

*  new: PSPDFKit is now compiled with Xcode 4.2/iOS Base SDK 5.0 (still works with 4.x)
*  improves compatibility for outline parser; now able to handle rare array/dict destination variants (fixes all destinations = page 1 error)
*  fixes a rare stack overflow when re-using zoomed scrollviews while scrolling.
*  fixes a compile problem on older Xcode versions. (It's not officially supported though - use Xcode 4.2 for the best experience!)
*  fixes a memory problem where iPad1 rarely tries to repaint a page forever

__v1.6.10 - 25/Sept/2011__

*  aspectRatioEqual now defaults to NO. Many customers oversee this and then send me (false) bug reports. Set this to YES for maximum speed if your document has one single aspect ratio (like most magazines should).
*  scroll to active page in grid view
*  fixes small offset-error in the scrobble bar

__v1.6.9 - 22/Sept/2011__

*  add option do debug memory usage (Instruments isn't always great)
*  improves memory efficiency on tile drawing, animations
*  improves performance, lazily creates gridView when first accessed
*  improves scrobble bar update performance
*  fixes memory problems on older devices like iPad 1, iPhone 3GS
*  fixes a problem with unicode files
*  fixes auto-switch to fitWidth on iPhone when location is default view

__v1.6.8 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  update thumbnail grid when document is changed via property

__v1.6.7 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  improves outline parser, now handles even more pdf variants

__v1.6.6 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  potential bug fix for concurrent disk operations (NSFileManager is not thread safe!)
*  fixes positioning problem using the (unsupported) combination of PSPDFScrollingVertical and fitWidth

__v1.6.5 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  fixes a bug where scroll position was remembered between pages when using fitWidth

__v1.6.4 - 15/Sept/2011__

*  new: didRenderPage-delegate
*  fixes: crash bug with NaN when started in landscape

__v1.6.3 - 14/Sept/2011__

*  new: maximumZoomScale-property is exposed in PSPDFViewController
*  changed: *realPage* is now remembered, not the page used in the UIScrollView. This fixes some problems with wrong page numbers.
*  fixes situation where page was changed to wrong value after view disappeared, rotated, and reappeared.
*  fixes option button in example is now touchable again
*  fixes a bug where HUD was never displayed again when rotating while a popover controller was visible
*  fixes potential crash where frame get calculated to NaN, leading to a crash on view rotation
*  fixes problems when compiling with GCC. You really should use LLVM/Clang though.

__v1.6.2 - 13/Sept/2011__

*  fixed: HUD is now black again on disabled status bar

__v1.6.1 - 13/Sept/2011__

*  new: open email sheet per default when detecting mailto: annotation links. (You now need the MessageUI.framework!)

*  fixes memory related crash on older devices
*  fixes crash when toolbarBackButton is nil
*  greatly improved KioskExample

*  changed: iPhone no longer uses dualPage display in landscape, now zooms current page to fullWidth
*  new: property fitWidth in PSPDFViewController lets you enable document fitting to width instead of largest element (usually height). Only works with horizontal scrolling

*  new: pdf view fades in. Duration is changeable in global var kPSPDFKitPDFAnimationDuration.

*  new: kPSPDFKitZoomLevels is now a global setting. It's set to a sensible default, so editing is not advised.
*  new: thumbnailSize is now changeable in PSPDFViewController
*  improve: faster locking in PSPDFCache, no longer freezes main thread on first access of pageCount

*  fixes bug where alpha of navigationBar was set even if toolbarEnabled was set to NO
*  fixes bug where initial page delegation event was not sent when switching documents
*  fixes crash related to too high memory pressure on older devices
